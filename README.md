### Live Demo @
## [FicoPrieto.github.io/AudioVisual-Framework-Demo](https://ficoprieto.github.io/AudioVisual-Framework-Demo)

&nbsp;  
This is a demo of a an audio-visual framework I'm developing which focuses on:
  - concise implementations that allow for rapid development by eliminating boilerplate
  - providing a comprehensive scope of classes and utilities, allowing intuitive navigation via naming conventions that closely match the real-world idioms of the domain
  - thorough typing to optimize the usage of IntelliSense

&nbsp;  
This project is a work-in-progress. My primary focus was to deliver well-written code along with a functional demo by the deadline of the apprenticeship application; so there are various aspects (*module design, testing, responsive UI design, generative graphics & music, etc.*) demonstrated throughout the project, but nothing is 100% complete. I will be continuously revisiting this project to further develop the modules, fully implement tests, add documentation, add usage examples (*maybe via [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org)*), and expand the implementation of the modules to further develop the live demo.
